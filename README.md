# Statistical-Inference-Tooth-Growth

This reproducible project was completed as part of the "Statistical Inference" certificate and part of the John Hopkins Data Science Specialisation.

The project is simply a useful revisit to the subject of statistical inference using the analysis of tooth growth by supplement and dosage and deploying some basic exploratory data analyses, summary statistics, assumptions and conclusions using  confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
